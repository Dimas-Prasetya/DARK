kotlin-dagger-rx-anko
=====================

This project demonstrate basic sample of an Android Project with Kotlin, Dagger 2, Rx and Anko.

It's forked from [kotlin-dagger-example](https://github.com/damianpetla/kotlin-dagger-example) that is a simple Kotlin + Dagger example (which helped me a lot with the Dagger initial configuration which is a pain in the ass :man: )
