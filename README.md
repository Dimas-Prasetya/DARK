KARD : kotlin-anko-rx-dagger
=====================

This project demonstrates a basic sample of an Android Project with Kotlin, Anko, Rx and Dagger 2.

It's forked from [kotlin-dagger-example](https://github.com/damianpetla/kotlin-dagger-example) that is a simple Kotlin + Dagger example (which helped me a lot with the Dagger initial configuration which is a pain in the ass :man:)

Ps: Since I'm using the Marvel API, to build the project you should add your Marvel public and private keys to your **local.properties** file.
